My-Own-Underscore
=================

15 functional underscore methods that I rewrote for practice. *Some functions may only work with arrays., so don't go replacing your underscore library just yet! Oh, but it's also like 3x smaller than the current underscore lib.

Functions include

_vc.reduce()
_vc.each()
_vc.filter()
